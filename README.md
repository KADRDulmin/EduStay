# EduStay

## Overview

EduStay is a revolutionary web application designed to bridge the gap between NSBM Green University students and the array of accommodation options available around the campus. This platform emerges as a comprehensive solution for students seeking convenient and safe housing, landlords looking to list their properties, and the university administration aiming to oversee and validate these listings. EduStay, our brand name, encapsulates our mission to make educational journeys as seamless as possible by ensuring students have a home away from home.

## Key Features and Functionalities

    For Landlords/Rental Agencies: Landlords have the ability to easily register and sign up at no cost. Once part of the EduStay community, they can upload detailed information about their properties, including images, facilities available, rental prices, and location. They maintain full control over their listings, with capabilities to add, update, and delete properties. Moreover, landlords can directly accept or reject reservation requests from students, making the rental process streamlined and efficient.

    For the Warden: The warden plays a crucial role in ensuring the suitability and safety of accommodations listed on EduStay. With access to a dashboard that presents all advertisements both as a list and on a map, the warden can easily review each property. This includes a thorough validation process through which they can approve or reject listings, ensuring they meet the university's standards for student living.

    For Students: Students are at the heart of EduStay. Our platform offers an intuitive interface where students can browse through a curated list of accommodations, view properties on a map, and access detailed information about each listing. The reservation feature allows students to directly request bookings, simplifying the process of finding the perfect place to stay during their studies.

    For the Web Master (Admin): The administrator has overarching control over the platform, including the ability to create accounts for all user types (landlords, the warden, and students). This role also encompasses posting informative articles and updates to assist users in making informed decisions about accommodations.

## Commitment to User Experience

EduStay Housing emphasizes a user-friendly interface, mirroring the simplicity and efficiency of modern web applications. The interaction between map markers and listings, along with the responsive design, ensures a seamless user experience across all devices.

## Security and Reliability

Our commitment extends to maintaining the highest standards of data security and privacy. Ensuring the protection of our users' information is paramount, making EduStay a trusted platform for all parties involved.

## Conclusion

EduStay is not just a platform; it's a community builder that enhances the university experience for NSBM Green University students by addressing one of their fundamental needs - finding a place to call home. EduStay invites landlords, the warden, and students to come together in a secure, efficient, and user-friendly environment, making the process of finding and offering accommodation smoother than ever.
